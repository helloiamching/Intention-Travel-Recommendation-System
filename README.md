# Abstract

This research presents an on-time travel recommendation system utilizing data from the Google
Maps API. Facilitating the content-based filtering method based on the intention network. The
recommendation algorithm incorporates linear regression for weight calculation, dynamically
adjusting weights based on user preferences. Through the experiment, the researchers are able to
evaluate the performance of the intention network in the recommendation system. Altogether,
this work highlights the potential of integrating keyword-based intention networks in travel
recommendation systems representing partial public trend on the internet.
